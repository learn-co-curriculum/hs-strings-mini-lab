# String Practice
### Part 1 - Testing string methods: What will each of these lines of code return?

?: puts "i am super excited about coding!".upcase
[-]

?: puts "racecar".reverse
[-]

?: puts "Hi! My name is, Joe".swapcase
[-]

?: puts "short string".length
[-]

?: puts "backwards".reverse.upcase
[-]

#### Now it's your turn to use string methods. 
?: Get enthusiastic about ruby! How do I print out "I love ruby" in all caps?
[-]

?: Use a method to print out how long this sentence is: "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?"
[-]

?: It's backwards day! How would you print "backwards" backwards?
[-]

?: Wouldn't it be great if there was a string method that always capitalized the first letter of each word? There is! "make it capitalize the first letter of each word in this string!"
[-]

?: How much do we love "Ruby"? So much that we want to say it in all caps AND backwards. How would you do this?
