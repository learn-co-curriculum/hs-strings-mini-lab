#### Now it's your turn to use string methods. 
?: Get enthusiastic about ruby! How do I print out "I love ruby" in all caps?
[-]

?: Use a method to print out how long this sentence is: "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?"
[-]

?: It's backwards day! How would you print "backwards" backwards?
[-]

?: Wouldn't it be great if there was a string method that always capitalized the first letter of a string? There is! "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!"
[-]

?: How much do we love "Ruby"? So much that we want to say it in all caps AND backwards. How would you do this?
