### String methods
Create a new file called `strings.rb` and write your answers in that file.

### What will the methods below print out?

**Hint:** If you're not sure - open up your terminal and type `irb` to start up interactive ruby. Then copy and paste the methods below to see what gets output.

1. puts "i am super excited about coding!".upcase

2. puts "racecar".reverse

3. puts "Hi! My name is, Joe".swapcase

4. puts "short string".length

5. puts "backwards".reverse.upcase

### Now it's your turn to use string methods. 
6. Get enthusiastic about ruby! Print out "I love ruby" in all caps.

7. Print out how long this sentence is: "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?"

8. It's backwards day! Print your name backwards.

9. Wouldn't it be great if there was a string method that always wrote out your name with the first letter capitalized? There is! Print it out. 

10. How much do we love ruby? So much that we want to say it in all caps AND backwards.
