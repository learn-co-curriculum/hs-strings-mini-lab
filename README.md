## String methods

### What will the methods below print out?

"racecar".reverse

"i am super excited about coding!".upcase

"Hi! My name is, Joe".swapcase

"short string".length

"racecar".reverse.upcase

### Now it's your turn to use string methods.

1. Get enthusiastic about ruby! Write code below to print out "I love ruby" in all caps.

2. Write code below will print out how long this sentence is: "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?"

3. It's backwards day! Write code below that will print your name backwards.

4. Wouldn't it be great if there was a string method that always wrote out your name with the first letter capitalized? There is! Write your code below 

5. How much do we love ruby? So much that we want to say it in all caps AND backwards. Write your code below.
